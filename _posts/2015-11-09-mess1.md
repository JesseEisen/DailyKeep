## Linux Command

### diff
**1.Basic use:**

+ -c  Use the context output format
    - "+" the former file is more than latter one
    - "-" the former file is less than latter one
    - "!" this two file have difference

+ -u  Use the unified output format

**2.Some owesome flags:**

+ -p  show the difference of the function, if the file is C source code
+ -y  use the side by side output format
+ -W  specify the width of output(use in side by side output format)
+ -b  ignore the white space characters
+ -B  ignore the space lines

**3.Patch**

    diff -ruN file1 file2 > patch.log
    patch file2 pathc.log  //patch file2 with patch.log


## Go Method 

### Format

when we define a type, this type can has a method. We just define a `func` with a force type first,like:

	type A struct{
		age int
	}

	func (a *A)Add(){
		a.age += 1
	}

So we have defined a method `Add` of struct `A`, and we can use following way to use this method.

	a := A{age:1}
	a.Add()  //now a.age becomes 2

### Any type 

Any type can has method. so we can use `type` keyword to decaler a new type, like:

	type TZ int

	func (tz *TZ)Add(num int){
		*tz += TZ(num)
	}

	func main(){
		var t TZ

		t.Add(10)  //now t = 10
		(*TZ).Add(&t,10)  //now t = 20
	}


We just implement two different way to use method, first way is called `method value` and the second way is called `method expression`. Both of them is correct. 

Notice: Even is `TZ` is a alias of `int`, we still need to convert `int` into `TZ` in the method.
