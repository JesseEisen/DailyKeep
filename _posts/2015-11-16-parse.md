## Tool

### lex

lex is a computer program that generates lexcial analyzers. Using regualr expression to scans the file, and get the identifiers.Lex will read this pattern and produce C code for a lexical analyzer.

[Here is the introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software))


### yacc

We often use this tool with lex. After parse, we will get some files:
	
	lex xxx.l
	yacc -d xxx.y

Here will get `y.tab.c` `y.tab.h` `lex.yy.c`, We still can write other .c file to do what you want to do. 

`Bison` and `flex` is the same tool like those two.
