## [Tips] Backtraces 

In C, the function invoking is like a stack, so when we use `bt` to print the backtrace we will get the function stack, like:

```c
#0  func2 () at bt.c:22
#1  0x0000000000400530 in func1 () at bt.c:18
#2  0x00000000004004dd in main () at bt.c:9
```

We can see the first colum is the frame id, and the left is the function address and function name.  As we see, The main is at the bottom of the stack, because it call first. 

when we want to go back to see what happend in `func1`, we can use `frame` to get back. like:

```c
(gdb) frame 1
#1  0x0000000000400530 in func1 () at bt.c:18
18        func2()
(gdb) bt
#0  func2 () at bt.c:22
#1  0x0000000000400530 in func1 () at bt.c:18
#2  0x00000000004004dd in main () at bt.c:9
```

Now we can print the variable in `func1`, but please notice that the backtrace not change. we only visit theframe 1. 

Also, if you want to visit the `#2`. One we can use `frame 2`, another way is use `down 1`. Both two ways can work will.

In gdb, there also some good command of `backtraces`. Here we go:

+ bt n:  
     print only the innermost n frames

+ bt -n:   
     print only the outermost n frames

+ bt full:  
     print the value of the local variables also.
