## 1.How to extract the string between two \n in a file

This category questions we can consider use the `awk` to slove. Because it is regularity. we can separate the line by `\n`, and make each part as a record.

```html
<span class="WebRupee">Rs.</span>\n29\n<br/><font style="font-size:smaller;font-weight:normal">\n3 days\n</font></td>
```

Here we need to parse the `29` `3 days` ect. We can find that the target is surrounded by `\n`. So we can use `awk` tp solve it.

```bash
awk 'NR%2 == 0' RS='\\\\n' input.txt
```

we separate the line into different record by `\n`. and the target is the on the even record. 

**Another Way**   
Also we can use the `grep` to solve that.Just match the string between `\n`. so we can do:

```bash
$ grep -o '\\n[^\\]*\\n' input.txt
\n29\n
\n3 days\n
```
So we just need to eliminate the `\n` surrounded. There are two ways to make that.

+ Use the GNU grep

If you use the GUN grep, we can use the `-P` which use the `perl like RE`. so the command should be 

```bash
grep -oP '(?<=\\n)[^\\<>]*(?=\\n)' input.txt
```

`(?<=\\n)` is a look-behind assertion and the `(?=\\n)` is look-ahead assertion.Both of them are the `Lookaround Assertions` in perl.
You can refer the [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html).


+ Use the `sed` to move that

```bash
grep -o '\\n[^\\]*\\n' input.txt | sed 's/\\n//g'
```

So, It all determined by you to use which way.
