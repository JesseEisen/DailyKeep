## How to add and remove Warning flags in gcc

This is a RTFM question, but there ara also some great points need to pay attention. First, when we add the `-Wall` flag. That means it **enables all the warnings**. The specify information you can refer the manual.

if you do not want to enable all the warning flags. You can follow below which refered by gcc manual.

> You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with ‘-W’, for example -Wimplicit to request warnings on implicit declarations. Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form beginning ‘-Wno-’ to turn off warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the default.
