## GO

### empty interface{}

+ This type is a interface that has no methods
+ All types satisfy the empty interface. That means that if you write a function that taks an *inteface{}* as an parameter, So that you can supply that function with any value

Confuse: which type variable can be passed into function.

    func Something(v interface{}){
        ....
    }

If `interface{}` can be any type, so which type of `v` in function `Something`? It still is the type `interface{}`. Because go have take a type convert. So v's static type still is `interface{}`

### implementation of interfaces

An interface value is constructed of two words of data;

+ one word is used to point to a method table for the valueâ€™s underlying type
+ the other word is used to point to the actual data being held by that value.

### Convert []T to  []interface{}

    t := []int{1,2,3,4}
    s := make([]interface{},len(t))
    for i,v := range t{
        s[i] = v
    }

So with that we can pass it to function which hava the parameter  `[]interfac{}`
