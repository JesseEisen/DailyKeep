### C error

Today i have got a error, "lvalue required as left operand of assignment".

This is cause by we assign a variable to a constant. Or, we use `if(a = 3)`. but sometimes, we can not find that easy.

see:

	#define add(sum,a,b)\
	({\ 
		int c = 0; \
		if(sum < 0) \
			sum = c; \
		sum = a + b; \
		sum;\
	}) 

so when we invoke this marco like this:`add(-1,a,b)`. That will get this error. This error is very hard to find. When this happened, we can to find this in `xx.i` file, the file after the preprocess. 


One way to solve this error is :

	#define add(sum,a,b)\
	({\ 
		int c = 0; \
		int tmp = sum;
		if(tmp < 0) \
			tmp = c; \
		tmp = a + b; \
		tmp;\
	}) 

And another way is implement it use `inline` keyword. 


That's all
